        <details>
            <summary><label>Is Unity transport Logistics a licensed and bonded company?</label></summary>

                protection from wind, rain, snow, and dirt, while an open trailer is more cost-effective but exposes
                your vehicle to the elements. Unity transport Logistics offers both options, so you can choose the one that

        </details>

        <details>
            <summary><label>What must I understand before placing my order?</label></summary>
            <p>We recommend visiting our Help Center page for advice on inspecting your car before shipping, choosing
                the right transportation mode, and reading our terms and conditions to avoid last-minute surprises.</p>
        </details>

        <details>

        </details>

        <details>
            <summary><label>How far in advance should I schedule my vehicle transport?</label></summary>
            <p>We recommend scheduling as soon as possible, ideally 5 days before the vehicle is available for pick-up.
                However, immediate pick-ups can often be arranged as well.</p>
        </details>

        </details>

        </details>

        <details>
            <summary><label>Will my vehicle be transferred to other trucks while in transit?</label></summary>

            <summary><label>Can I choose a particular spot on the trailer?</label></summary>
            <p>Most drivers will load your vehicle wherever they think it is safe. Truckers have to deal with multiple
                factors when it comes to loading your vehicle. They have to make sure that they fit all cars properly so
                that they don’t exceed the permitted length of the truck. They also need to follow all federal laws and
                ensure there is no overweight on any of the axles.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary><label>Can I ship my personal belongings?</label></summary>

                placed in the front or back seat below window level. The driver's seat must always be empty. Note that
                personal belongings inside your vehicle will not be insured.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary><label>Is my vehicle going to be insured?</label></summary>
            <p>Yes, we provide full bumper-to-bumper insurance. For open trailer transport, your vehicle is insured for
                at least $250,000, and for enclosed trailer transport, it's insured up to $1 million. This includes

        <details>
            <summary><label>Do I need to be present for pickup or delivery?</label></summary>
            <p>Yes, someone must be present during pickup and delivery. You or an authorized person can sign the bill of
                lading and observe the driver’s vehicle inspection. Once the inspection is complete and the bill of
                lading is signed, you may leave.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary><label>I will not be available for the pickup and/or delivery, what do I do?</label></summary>
            <p>You can arrange for a family member, friend, or co-worker to be present. It is important that they are
                well-informed about the inspection process upon loading/unloading. Ensure they note the vehicle’s
                condition on the bill of lading upon delivery and report any damages if found.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary><label>What paperwork do I need to sign upon pick-up?</label></summary>
            <p>You only need to provide the keys to the driver and sign the bill of lading. There is no need for your
                vehicle's title or insurance at pickup.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary><label>My car should be picked up from the auction, what should I know?</label></summary>
            <p>If your car is being picked up from an auction, we require the company name, address, VIN, lot, and
                buyer's number before the pickup date.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary><label>Once a driver is assigned to my car job, what can I expect next?</label></summary>
            <p>KeepMoving Logistics will provide the name and phone number of the assigned driver. The driver will
                contact you 24 hours before pickup and again one hour before arriving. The driver will inspect your
                vehicle, you’ll sign the bill of lading, and the vehicle will be loaded.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary><label>Can you still ship my car if it is inoperable?</label></summary>
            <p>Yes, but the condition must be noted when you place your order. An inoperable fee of approximately $150
                will be added to the transport cost. Please inform us in advance so we can assign the right driver for
                your vehicle.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary><label>How do I track my vehicle while in transit?</label></summary>
            <p>We will provide you with estimated pickup and delivery times. You will also get the driver’s name and
                phone number. If you cannot reach the driver, you can contact Unity transport Logistics at (727) 472-8600 or
                info@unitytransportlogistics.com for assistance.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary><label>What should I do with my E-Z Pass or automatic collection pass?</label></summary>
            <p>Remove your E-Z Pass or any other electronic toll collection devices from your vehicle before transport.
                Otherwise, you may incur toll fees as if you were driving the vehicle. Unity transport Logistics will not be
                responsible for these fees.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary><label>Are you a broker or a carrier?</label></summary>
            <p>We operate as both brokers and carriers. Unity transport Logistics does not charge broker fees like other
                companies, making us one of the best in the U.S.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary><label>Are there any restrictions on what types of vehicles you can ship?</label></summary>
            <p>We can ship most cars, vans, SUVs, and light trucks. However, special equipment may be necessary for
                valuable, oversized, heavily modified, or totaled vehicles. Please confirm with us if you have an
                unusual vehicle before booking.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary><label>What is a Bill of Lading, and why is it important for transport shipping?</label></summary>
            <p>A bill of lading is a contract between you and the shipping company that includes details of the shipment
                and serves as proof of the terms. It’s essential because it provides legal documentation in case of
                disputes.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary><label>Do I have to pay everything when I make a reservation?</label></summary>
            <p>You must pay an initial deposit to make a reservation. The balance is due on delivery, and it can be paid
                with cash, cashier’s check, or money order directly to the driver.</p>
